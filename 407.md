> This is probably the best TV I’ve ever watched. From the acting, to the cinematography, to the story, it’s all around an incredible piece of work.

> The anti-social behavior, the loneliness he keeps, the split-personality of wanting and imagining a father who protects him - it all makes sense.

> Now that we know Elliot's history, the hug between Gideon and Elliot in season 1 just feels heartwarming and heartbreaking in a different way.

> Anyone else think the Acts corresponded with the stages of grief?

> Stage 1: Denial - Elliot is in denial about the whole situation  
Stage 2: Anger - Mr. Robot goes in on Vera  
Stage 3: Bargaining - Elliot bargains for Krista's life  
Stage 4: Depression - The whole twist  
Stage 5: Acceptance - Vera helped him accept what happened
